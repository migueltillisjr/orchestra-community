"""Render the assembled business card's front and back as high-resolution PNGs.

Loads 02_print_prep/output/business_card.html in a headless browser and
screenshots the .front and .back card elements directly, the same way the
business_card_studio's "Download PNG" buttons capture the live DOM. This is
the print-prep export mechanism for stage 02_print_prep, replacing the
manual fpdf2 redraw in export_pdf.py.

Uses Playwright's own bundled Chromium (not a system-installed browser), so
this also runs on headless servers/containers with no workstation UI or
browser installed. Run `python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium`
once per environment before the first export.
